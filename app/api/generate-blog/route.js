          Write a detailed, SEO-optimized blog article of at least 2200 words for Nexy, a power bank rental service based in Vancouver, Canada (website: nexy.ca). The article should be informative, engaging, and written in a professional but friendly tone.
                The topic is: ${prompt}
                The article should highlight the benefits of using Nexyâ€™s power bank rental stations, including convenience, accessibility, and eco-friendliness. Mention how Nexy works (rent a power bank, return it at any station), and include use cases for events, travelers, students, and businesses.
                Make sure to naturally include relevant SEO keywords such as:
                "power bank rental Vancouver"   
                "portable phone charger"
                "rent a power bank"
                "charging station for events"
                "Nexy power bank"
                "mobile charging solutions"
                Use subheadings (H2, H3), bulleted lists, and a clear introduction and conclusion. Include a call to action at the end, inviting readers to visit nexy.ca or try a Nexy station near them.
          The response should be in JSON format with the following structure:
          {
            "title": "Blog post title",
            "description": "A brief description of the blog post",
            "content": "The main content of the blog post in HTML format with proper paragraphs and formatting",
            "category": "A relevant category for the blog post"
          }`,
        },
        {

      max_tokens: 4000,
